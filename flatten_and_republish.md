```

## Step 3: Create New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository named `KeybowFlow`
2. **Description**: "Professional workflow automation for Keybow 2040 - Multi-layer configurations, RGB themes, and comprehensive action support"
3. **Make it Public**
4. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these)

## Step 4: Push to New Repository

```powershell
# Add the new remote (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/KeybowFlow.git

# Push the new single-commit history
git push -u origin keybowflow-main

# Set keybowflow-main as the default branch on GitHub
# (You can do this in GitHub repo settings > Branches)
```

## Step 5: Create v1.0.0 Release

```powershell
# Tag the commit as v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0: KeybowFlow Professional Workflow Automation

4. **Website**: Add your documentation site if you have one

## Step 7: Verify Release Artifacts

After pushing the tag, GitHub Actions should automatically:
1. Build `keybowflow-device-files.zip`
2. Build `keybowflow-examples.zip` 
3. Create release with artifacts
4. Include CircuitPython firmware

## Notes

- The old repository can be archived/deleted after confirming the new one works
- Update any external links or documentation to point to the new repository
